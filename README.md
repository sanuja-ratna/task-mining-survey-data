Task mining is a method of recording tasks that happen in a business process that we review for process improvement and automation opportunities so you can think of it like a preliminary step.

The way it works is you capture a task using the app as shown in the screenshots in the powerpoint, create a new project/continue with an existing project and start recording each of your clicks 
(pausing/stopping as required).  

Benefits include:
•	Useful for process discovery
•	Helps identify patterns and draw observations from complex/repetitive workflows
•	Defines as-is process by looking at how tasks are completed from the user’s perspective and generates a PDD template

Limitations are:
•	Provides a starting point for development by only showing the as-is process

Some use cases for this feature would be when you’re working with a complex workflow so there’s multiple apps/steps to develop, when you’re discovered new/undocumented processes, or when onboarding/learning. 
The use case I chose to explore is the first where I’m retrieving, analyzing, and reporting on survey results using Outlook, Excel, ChatGPT, Word.
